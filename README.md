Make sure to run this after Java Backend, since Java is responsible for creating the database, without it, this cannot put data.

to run:

from the terminal execute these commands:
1. npm install
2. npm start

when the execution is finished, some default json values will be added in the database.

For mongo:
1. Go to the bin folder where mongodb is installed.
2. Create a folder with the name movieList.
3. Then open powershell in bin and execute this .\mongod.exe --dbpath movieList
